# Dice Bag

Dice Bag is a library of rake tasks for configuring web apps in the style of
[The Twelve-Factor App][1]. It also provides continuous integration tasks that
rely on the configuration tasks.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'dice_bag', :git => 'git@github.com:mdsol/dice_bag.git'
```

The current `ci` tasks assume you are using the shamus and brakeman tools, so
add the following to your `Gemfile` if you intend to use these tasks:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'shamus', :git => 'git@github.com:mdsol/shamus.git', :tag => '0.9.6'
  gem 'brakeman', '~> 1.8'
end
```

You should specify versions appropriate for your project! No need to deploy
these in production, so we scope them to the appropriate groups.

If you are using these tasks outside of a Rails project, add the following to
your `Rakefile` or wherever your local rake tasks are defined:

```ruby
require 'dice_bag/tasks'
```

Now run the following command to see the new tasks in the `config` and `ci`
namespaces:

```
[bundle exec] rake -T
```

### Setting commit status in GitHub

The main `ci` task will update the current `HEAD` commit in the associated
GitHub repo. To do so, a [GitHub OAuth][go] authorization token is required and
must be provided in the `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, for example:

[go]: http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/

```
[bundle exec] rake GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=123... ci
```

CI servers like Jenkins let you set system-wide environment variables, saving
the need of specifying this in every job. The status update is skipped if no
token is provided.

Create an authorization token with the following command:

```
curl -u <username> -d '{"scopes":["repo:status"],"note":"CI status updater"}' https://api.github.com/authorizations
```

You will be prompted for your GitHub account password.

The token is restricted to updating commit status only. The token is associated
to the given user, as are any commit statuses created using it. The note given
is the display name used in the GitHub account management pages and tokens can
be revoked from there.

The commit status created uses the `BUILD_NUMBER` and `BUILD_URL` environment
variables as [provided by Jenkins][je]. Alternatively, these can be provided or
overridden on the command line, for example:

```
[bundle exec] rake BUILD_NUMBER=$MY_BUILD_NUM BUILD_URL=http://example.com/url ci
```

## TODO

* Describe the template-and-environment-driven processing here.
* Make the `ci:run` task detect installed tools (but this is possibly a non-goal
  if we want to be opinionated about the CI tool-chain).
* Make `config:db` use `db/schema.rb` if present rather than migrate a clean
  database.
* Possibly move database migrations from `ci:config` to `config:db` (ask
  DevOps).
* Add `config:generate:rails:db` or similar to spew out standard templates.
